# open-source-ideas

Do you have an open source idea that could improve science, healthcare, or is Bioinformatics-related? Then, you've found the right GitHub repository!

## Purpose

With so many of us in STEM working on grants and research, it's hard to find time to create useful tools (that aren't directly related to a project) or rewrite useful tools that can help a number of scientists by making their work easier. If you have an idea that fits that mold (even if you aren't a scientist), then please share it with us.

## Submit An Idea
