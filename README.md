# open-source-ideas

Do you have an open source idea that could improve science, healthcare, or is Bioinformatics-related? Submit it here.

With so many of us in STEM working on grants and research, it's hard to find time to create useful tools (that aren't directly related to a project) or rewrite useful tools that can help a number of scientists by making their work easier. If you have an idea that fits that mold (even if you aren't a scientist), then please share it with us.

View the [idea template](https://github.com/datasnakes/open-source-ideas/blob/master/idea_template.md) and add your idea to the main [README.md](https://github.com/datasnakes/open-source-ideas/blob/master/README.md) by submitting a PR.
